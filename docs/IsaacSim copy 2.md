RMF traffic: If a vertex is not connected to a lane, IT WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE NAV GRAPH!!

Nav2 critic scale: https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/105749/dwb-planner-in-nav2-does-not-properly-set-scale-for-critics

To get RMF fleet manager to recognize completed task, robot state must have empty path, and mode set to idle or charging


Forked from [linorobot2](https://github.com/linorobot/linorobot2).

## Startup Instructions

1. Run `xhost +local:docker` to allow RVIZ to display from Docker containers.
2. In `.env`, set _SLAM_OR_NAV_ to either _NAV_ or _SLAM_.
3. (Optional) Plug in a Microsoft Xbox controller (Model 1914) to USB.
4. Run `docker compose build`.
5. Run `docker compose up`. It may take 1-2 minutes for Gazebo to load. A `teleop twist` terminal window will open for you to drive the robot.
6. If running NAV, set the robot's starting position in RVIZ2 with the "2D pose estimate" button. Spin the robot a few times until the scans and map line up in RVIZ2.
7. Drive the robot using:
   - Xbox controller (Hold the right bumper and toggle the right joystick to move), **or**
   - Run `docker exec -it linorobot2-nav-slam bash` and `ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard` to control the robot via keyboard.

## Expected Results

- Gazebo will display a view of the robot and the world, including all the lidar scans.

- SLAM: RVIZ will open with the robot's view of the world and should begin auto-generating a map using SLAM.
