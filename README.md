## Map Cleanup

1. Install gimp: `apt install gimp`
2. Open gimp and open the .pgm map image file generated by nav2

4. Remove any dynamic obstacles that should not be in the static costmap with the `Eraser Tool`.

5. Select `Tools -> Transform tools -> Rotate`, and rotate the image until the pipe rail lengths look horizontal. Rotation will induce a blur.

_The edges of a rotated pipe rail should not slant from one row of pixels up or down, but be perfectly level._

7. Select `Image -> Canvas Size` and change the canvas to fit the rotated image.

9. Select `Filters -> Enhance -> Sharpen`. Change the "Amount" parameter until the pipe rails show up black.

_The edges of a rotated & sharpened pipe rail should not slant from one row of pixels up or down, but be perfectly level._

9. Use the `Pencil Tool` with white ink to remove any undesired dark pixels added in the sharpening.

11. Press `Ctrl + Shift + E` and export the new map to .pgm format (use default export settings).
12. Press `Ctrl + Shift + E` and export the new map to .png format, if you want to use it in RMF traffic editor (use default export settings).

## Adding keepout zones to map

1. Follow [this](https://docs.nav2.org/tutorials/docs/navigation2_with_keepout_filter.html) tutorial to create the .pgm and .yaml files that represent a keepout mask.
2. For compatbility with RMF traffic editor, set the map origin in the yaml file to `[0.0, y, 0.0]`, where `y = -1 * resolution * map height in px` (You can find map height in the .pgm file's properties).
3. Edit [filter_mask_server.yaml](/linorobot2_navigation/config/filter_mask_server.yaml) -> `filter_mask_server -> yaml_filename` to point to the yaml file that lists your keepout filter .pgm image.
4. Run ___-compose.yaml. The keepout filter can be viewed in foxglove or rviz2.

RMF traffic: If a vertex is not connected to a lane, IT WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE NAV GRAPH!!

To get RMF fleet manager to recognize completed task, robot state must have empty path, and mode set to idle or charging

## Startup Instructions

1. Run `xhost +local:docker` to allow RVIZ to display from Docker containers.
2. In `.env`, set _SLAM_OR_NAV_ to either _NAV_ or _SLAM_.
3. (Optional) Plug in a Microsoft Xbox controller (Model 1914) to USB.
4. Run `docker compose build`.
5. Run `docker compose up`. It may take 1-2 minutes for Gazebo to load. A `teleop twist` terminal window will open for you to drive the robot.
6. If running NAV, set the robot's starting position in RVIZ2 with the "2D pose estimate" button. Spin the robot a few times until the scans and map line up in RVIZ2.
7. Drive the robot using:
   - Xbox controller (Hold the right bumper and toggle the right joystick to move), **or**
   - Run `docker exec -it linorobot2-nav-slam bash` and `ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard` to control the robot via keyboard.

## Expected Results

- Gazebo will display a view of the robot and the world, including all the lidar scans.
  
  ![Gazebo View](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb57d7c8-b000-4d7e-bef2-c3fcf2c7c44f)

- SLAM: RVIZ will open with the robot's view of the world and should begin auto-generating a map using SLAM.
  
  ![RVIZ Map View](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4be799ff-4d3a-48c9-b58a-216c756eebee)

- NAV: RVIZ will open the robots view of the world with the pre-generated map.
